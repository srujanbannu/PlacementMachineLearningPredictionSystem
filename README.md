# PlacementMachineLearningPredictionSystem

##Fear makes an important role in the decision-making process. It makes us assess ourselves and sometimes lowers our confidence. It leads to self-evaluation and, at times, reduces our self-assurance. In a hypothetical case, a student plagued by this concern could make a poor decision by picking a moderately paid job that falls well short of his or her competence and potential. This one terrible decision might be the first of many bad decisions, leading to a disastrous professional career. In this study, we looked at how to overcome the obstacles that students confront in the early stages of their careers so that they might pursue a thriving future. As a result, his self-confidence will be boosted, and he/she will be able to perform better during the recruitment, allowing him to make better decisions. A student fills in the required fields and receives the predictor's result, which determines the possibility of a better placement. This will increase one's self-assurance and capability. Supervised machine learning techniques were used to classify the probabilities and curate them into an efficient working model with a high percentage of accuracy, including a friendly user interface.
